					<h2>Early Years and Education</h2>
					<p>
						Katherine Johnson, a pioneering figure in American mathematics and
						space exploration, was born Katherine Coleman in 1918 in the small
						town of White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. Even as a young child,
						her extraordinary mathematical abilities were evident, leading her
						to complete the eighth grade by the age of 10. However, her path was
						not without obstacles. Segregation in education meant that her local
						schools could not provide her with further schooling. Determined to
						support Katherine's academic pursuits, her family made the
						significant decision to relocate 120 miles to Institute, West
						Virginia, where she could attend a high school that served African
						American students.
					</p>

					<p>
						At West Virginia State College, Katherine thrived under the guidance
						of Dr. William W. Schieffelin Claytor, the third African American to
						earn a PhD in mathematics. She immersed herself in her studies,
						demonstrating exceptional talent and dedication. By the age of 18,
						she graduated summa cum laude with degrees in both mathematics and
						French.
					</p>

					<p>
						Despite being selected for a program to desegregate West Virginia
						University's graduate school, Katherine chose a different path. She
						felt a strong calling to teach and embarked on a career educating
						others. Throughout the late 1930s, she shared her knowledge and
						passion for mathematics and French with students across various
						schools in Virginia and West Virginia. This experience instilled in
						her a deep commitment to education and laid the foundation for her
						future groundbreaking contributions.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="work-life">
					<h2>Career at NASA</h2>
					<p>
						In 1952, Johnson applied for a position at the National Advisory
						Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), which was recruiting African
						American women as computational specialists. She joined the Langley
						Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, in 1953.
					</p>

					<p>
						Her exceptional computational skills and intellectual initiative
						quickly set her apart. Reflecting on her approach, she once said,
						“While others followed prescribed procedures, I sought to understand
						the underlying principles and asked analytical questions.
					</p>

					<p>
						After NACA became NASA in 1958, Johnson played a key role in
						advancing human spaceflight. Her precise trajectory calculations
						were critical for Alan Shepard’s 1961 spaceflight, America’s first
						venture into space, and John Glenn’s 1962 orbital mission. Even as
						NASA adopted electronic computers, Johnson’s expertise remained
						vital, contributing to the Apollo 11 lunar landing in 1969 and the
						safe return of Apollo 13 in 1970 after its malfunction.
					</p>

					<p>
						Until her retirement in 1986, Johnson made significant contributions
						to NASA’s Space Shuttle program and the Earth Resources Satellite
						project.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="career-accomplishments">
					<h2>Awards and Accomplishments</h2>
					<p>
						Her exceptional career garnered numerous accolades, including the
						1967 NASA Lunar Orbiter Spacecraft and Operations team award and the
						National Technical Association's 1997 Mathematician of the Year
						recognition. She also received honorary degrees from several
						prestigious institutions: SUNY Farmingdale, Maryland's Capitol
						College, Virginia's Old Dominion University, and West Virginia
						University.
					</p>
					<p>
						In November 2015, President Barack Obama bestowed upon Johnson the
						Presidential Medal of Freedom. Her remarkable story, along with
						those of her fellow African American computers, gained widespread
						recognition through Margot Lee Shetterly's 2016 book Hidden Figures:
						The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Who
						Helped Win the Space Race. The subsequent Oscar-nominated film
						adaptation, Hidden Figures, featured Taraji P. Henson portraying
						Johnson.
					</p>

					<p>
						In September 2017, NASA commemorated Johnson's legacy by dedicating
						the Katherine G. Johnson Computational Research Facility at the
						Langley Research Center. Johnson, then 99, attended the ceremony
						with family and friends.
